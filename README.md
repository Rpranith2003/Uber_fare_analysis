# Uber_fare_analysis
This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict Uber ride fares using data from Kaggle.

### Data Preparation
The initial step in this data analytics project involves analyzing the dataset. This encompasses cleaning the data, identifying and handling missing values, and visualizing the data to uncover any discernible patterns or trends. During the data cleaning phase, rows containing missing or duplicate values were removed. Moreover, outlier detection and handling were performed.

### Visualizing Data
The dataset was visualized through various plots and charts. These visualizations revealed intriguing patterns and trends. For instance, it became apparent that average fares were notably higher during peak hours compared to other times of the day. Additionally, it was observed that the highest average fares occurred at the beginning of the month.

### Machine Learning Development
Moving forward, the project focused on constructing a machine learning model to predict taxi fares. Several machine learning algorithms, including linear regression and random forests, were assessed for their effectiveness. Ultimately, the random forest model demonstrated superior performance.

### Model Assessment
The effectiveness of the random forest model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared score. MAE quantifies the average error between predicted and actual values and is a standard performance indicator. RMSE measures the squared difference between predicted and actual values. The R-squared score assesses the correlation between predicted and actual values. The random forest model yielded an average MAE of $2.01, an average RMSE of $3.45, and an R-squared score of 0.78.
